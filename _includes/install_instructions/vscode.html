  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. We recommend to install 
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a> 
    as your main IDE / Code Editor in this workshop.
